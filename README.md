#MANAGING THE STRINGS FILES

The app need a "master" strings file with all the strings, and a "secondary" strings file that needs to be filled.
You have two kinds of views:
- show only the diff strings between the two strings files
- show the merged strings between the two strings files

You can edit the displayed strings file, and then you can save it in two ways:
- save only the diff strings between the two strings files
- save the merged strings between the two strings files

With the "Clear All" button you can reset and clean all the fields.
